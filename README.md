Sports Betting Analysis

This is a tool for estimating the probabilities of outcomes for sports events.  It will consist of a few different components:

- An evaluation tool that can take a given strategy and it apply it to historical betting opportunities and calculate what wins and losses would have been had that strategy been employed.
- A tool which will simulate games, play by play, to predict outcomes.  The simulations will be based off of historical game date.  Many of these simulations will be run in order to output a probability of a given outcome.

Initially, we will focus on NBA games, as there is plentiful data to support this, but we should be a solution that is not difficult to apply to other sports as well.

You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. I am working on a project called SBET, a Python project aimed at developing predictive models for calculating the probabilities of outcomes for sporting events, starting with NBA games.

Here is the relevant context for the project:

1. The project uses historical play-by-play logs to generate simulations of future games and estimate the chances of a team winning or losing.
2. The project includes tools for analyzing and validating sports prediction models by comparing generated probabilities with historical betting odds to determine profitable strategies.
3. The project is written in Python and makes use of typing annotations.
4. The code is 'compiled' using mypy to ensure type consistency.
5. The code repository is located at: https://github.com/greggg230/sbet
6. The data models are divided into CSV models and derived models.
7. The parsing functions read CSV files into data classes.
8. The transformation functions convert parsed data into more useful models.
9. Test files should be prefixed with 'test_'.
10. Ensure two newlines between imports and top-level objects (functions, classes).

Please continue from where we left off.

You are assisting with a software project for developing a predictive model for calculating the probabilities of outcomes for sporting events, starting with NBA games. The project involves:

1. Parsing historical data from CSV files:
   - `nba_teams_all.csv`
   - `nba_games_all.csv`
   - `nba_betting_money_line.csv`

2. Using Python with typing annotations and ensuring type consistency with mypy.

3. Creating data models:
   - `Team`
   - `Game`
   - `MoneyLineBettingOdds`
   - `NbaGame`
   - `NbaMoneyLineBettingOpportunity`

4. Transforming parsed data into more useful models.

5. Implementing unit tests:
   - Tests are split into separate files within appropriate modules.
   - Parsing tests are located in `sbet/tests/data/parsing/`.
   - Transformation tests are located in `sbet/tests/transform/`.

6. The top-level module of the project is `sbet`.

7. The GitHub repository is located at: https://github.com/greggg230/sbet

Remember to:
- Add two newlines between import statements and the first top-level object in a file.
- Split example usage into separate code blocks.
- Use class names and file prefixes as agreed (e.g., `test_` for test files).

Recent Updates:
- Transformation of `MoneyLineBettingOdds` to `NbaMoneyLineBettingOpportunity` has been simplified.
- The `NbaGame` class now includes scores for home and away teams.
- The `Game` model's `pts` field has been changed from `float` to `int`.
- Parsing test cases now use temporary files for CSV data and pass the file paths to the parsing functions.
